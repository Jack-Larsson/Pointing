# Pointing Fingers: Using Image Segmentation to Improve Gesture Recognition

Understanding non-verbal cues
like hand gestures, specifically pointing, is vital for robots
to effectively interpret and communicate with people. Finger-
pointing is a universally understood gesture that is an important
part of interpersonal interactions. This project implementes a method
utilizing image segmentation for a robot to understand pointing
at a specific target object. In our testing, we were able to show
88% accuracy in selecting the desired target object. The focus of this project was not on the identification and recognition of a pointing
gesture, but shows an effective method for interpreting a pointing
gesture that is known to be happening within the frame of the
camera.
